You must have a general idea how the react app works and npm,npx kindof libraries should be installed in the system.
if you get
"npm : The term 'npm' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the 
name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again."
means you have not installed npm or the path is not set correctly.Please study a little bit of creating react projects and do  it in correct way.

Technologies used:
Database : Mongodb
Framework: React.js

To run this project:
Backend:
    cd into backend
    run "npm install" to install the dependencies of backend
    rename .env.example to .env 
    run"npm start"

    if you have done it correctly you will see msg "Server is listening on http://localhost:8080"
    then you are all set to go.

Frontend:
    cd into frontend
    npm install
    npm start

    if you have done it correctly you will see msg "Server is listening on http://localhost:8080"
